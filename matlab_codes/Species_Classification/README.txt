This set of codes are used for atomic species classifications in our recent publication 

Yang et al., ??Deciphering chemical order/disorder and material properties at the single-atom level??, Nature 542, 75 (2017).

Please see the "method" section of the paper for detailed description of the algorithm.

FePt_Atomic_Species_Classification_Main.m is the main function to start with.

Most of the input data for this script is either included in this package, but some of them (ex. 3D reconstruction volume)

can be separately downloaded from our group website (http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/FePt).
