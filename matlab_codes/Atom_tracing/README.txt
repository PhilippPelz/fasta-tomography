This set of codes are used for peak tracing for finding atom positions in 3D reconstruction of an FePt nanoparticle
by 3D Gaussian fitting of local maxima within the 3D reconstruction.

Yang et al., ¡°Deciphering chemical order/disorder and material properties at the single-atom level¡±, Nature 542, 75 (2017).
Please see the "method" section of the paper for the description of the algorithm.

FePt_Peak_Tracing_Main.m is the main function to start with.

Most of the input data for this script is either included in this package, but some of them (ex. 3D reconstruction volume)

can be separately downloaded from our group website (http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/FePt).
